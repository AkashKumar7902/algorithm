<h3>Spanning Tree</h3>
Spanning tree of a graph is a subset of edges that connects graph into one connected components without cycle

<h3>Minimum Spanning Tree</h3>
A minimum spanning tree(MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycle and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
