 --------------Recursion-------------------------
  Recursion in computer science is a method where 
  solution to a problem depends on solutions to
  smaller instances of the same problem.
-------------------------------------------------

  Parts of recursion algorithm 
  1) Base case
  2) Recursive call (to work towards Base case) 
  
  while solving recursion question 
  if there is a case of choices, then make recursive tree.
  If u make the recursive tree then writing code will be a cakewalk.
  
  If its not the case of choices,
  do the following (Principle of Mathematical Induction) (PMI) :
  1) Figure out the Base Case
  2) Assume sub Problems can be solved by recursion (automatically)
  3) using the Sub- Problems write the answer for the current problem.
  Lets call this Method IBH (Induction- Base case - Hypothesis).
